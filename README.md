## Who is the user?
The user is someone who would like to search by title or topic and get a list of book titles in return. Wants to be able to go back and forth between the results and book information seemlessly to make a decision on what book they want to read.

This project not only fullfills the users wants, but also provides a link to the book in Google Books for the rest of the information the API provides about that particular book. This will allow the user to gain more information to obtain the book, such as how to view it for free.<br><br>
